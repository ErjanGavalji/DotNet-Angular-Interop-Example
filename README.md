- Demonstrate the initialization of the Glue42 interop engine with
Shared Contexts as an interop model.
- Demonstrate a two-way interop between a WPF (Desktop) application and an
AngularJS (Web) one.

4. Navigate to the `angular-app` folder
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npm run serve`
7. Start a Windows Explorer and navigate to the `dotnet-app` folder
8. Load the `dotnet-app.sln` file in Visual Studio and rebuild
9. Create the folder `%localappdata%\Tick42\Demos\SharedContextDemo-WPF`
10. Copy the files from the build output (e.g. `\bin\Debug`) to the `%localappdata%\Tick42\Demos\SharedContextDemo-WPF` folder
11. Use the AppManager (LaunchPad) to start the two applications
